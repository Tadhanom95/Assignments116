    <p>My favorite subject is <a
            href="https://engineeringbookspdf.com/calculus-7th-edition-pdf-free-download/3264/">math</a> because
        I like playing with numbers and solving math problems. Mathematics gives me
        alot of satisfaction and enhances my energy and thinking skills during my research.
        I love number games and can solve problems for hours without getting bored.</p>
    <p id="schools">My Favorite football team of all the time is <a href="https://www.manutd.com">manchester united fc </a> and
        <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/">Barcelona fc</a> . I began to watch football during
        David Beckham and david villa era. They used to broadcast the game when we were about to sleep around mid night,
        because the time in europe and africa was different. I loved the way they used to play. Especially united use to
        dominating back then in the 90s. I sometimes tried to watch at home but i do not enjoy it because it is more
        enjoyable
        when you watching it with a group of peoples. My dream is to attend a match in Old Traford and Campunu .Last but
        not list my favorite player of all the time is <a
        href="https://www.barcelona.com/barcelona_tickets/fc_barcelona_football_tickets/players/lionel_messi">Lionel
        Anders messi</a>
    </p>
    <p id="schools">I went school to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekelle_University">Mekelle university </a>in Tigray and 
        <a href="https://www.edmonds.edu/">Edmonds Community College </a> in Seattle,WA in 2018 after i come to US.</p>
